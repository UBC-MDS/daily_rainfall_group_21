# Predicting daily rainfall in Australia 

**Authors**: Lianna Hovhannisyan, Scarlett Qingqing Song, Linhan Cai, Siqi Tao

As our first exposure to cloud computing, we aim to build an ensemble model using the output of different models. The data can be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). It is the dump of modelled and observed daily rainfall data in Australia, spanning 1889 - 2014. The dataset is around 6GB. 

The end goal is to deploy to the cloud the fully-functioning machine learning ensemble model that predicts the daily rainfall in Australia. The features will be composed of the outputs of the different models. The predictions will be compared to the actual rainfall observation.
